For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and produce outputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` where the `N` dimension gives the minibatch size and the `(H, W)` dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.\n","\n","If the feature map was produced using convolutions, then we expect the statistics of each feature channel to be relatively consistent both between different imagesand different locations within the same image. Therefore spatial batch normalization computes a mean and variance for each of the `C` feature channels by computing statistics over both the minibatch dimension `N` and the spatial dimensions `H` and `W`.\n","\n","\n","[3] [Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing\n","Internal Covariate Shift\", ICML 2015.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E_iq56-_PVFr"},"source":["## Spatial batch normalization: forward\n","\n","In the file `cs6353/layers.py`, implement the forward pass for spatial batch normalization in the function `spatial_batchnorm_forward`.
